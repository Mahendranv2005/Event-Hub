# 🚀 EventHub – College Event Management System

## 📚 Project Introduction
**EventHub** is a comprehensive full-stack **MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application designed to revolutionize how college events are discovered, registered for, and tracked.

It serves as a one-stop platform for students, event organizers, and administrators to manage and participate in academic and technical events across India. The platform provides features like personalized dashboards, event registration, QR code ticket generation, and achievement tracking. 🎉

## 🛑 Problem Statement
College event management often lacks centralization, making it difficult for students to find and register for relevant events, track their participation, or showcase their achievements.

Event organizers face challenges in promoting events, managing registrations, and engaging participants.

There is no centralized platform allowing students to maintain a structured record of their event participation and achievements. 🤔

## 💡 Proposed Solution
**EventHub** offers a unified platform where students, event organizers, and administrators can interact seamlessly.

Key features include:

- Discover and register for events across multiple categories (hackathons, symposiums, tech summits, meetups, conferences, etc.).
- QR code generation for event entry and easy check-ins.
- Leaderboards and point systems to encourage participation and recognize top performers.
- Real-time notifications and reminders to keep participants engaged and informed.
- User dashboards to track achievements, points, and event participation. 🏆
